This algorithm utlizes three/four terms of Fourier function. The function is used to describe how wifi signal strength of each access point changes along distance/hallway. After data collection, use matlab (check Example.sift in Old Algorithm folder) curve fitting tools to get parameters for each specific hallway. This function then becomes 'ground truth' and we use real data to match this curve.
