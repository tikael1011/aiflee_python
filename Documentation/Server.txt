The usage of server script is very simple, just type 'python3 server_init.py' at terminal.(connect to our server first and change directory to the script). As long as the terminal window is open, the script will keep monitoring new incoming data sent from andorid app and output location of that specific data to the location folder on our server. In order to avoid to invoke server firewall mechanism, the update interval is 5 seconds. The computation time for output is rought 0.5s and it can deal with multi-threading.
